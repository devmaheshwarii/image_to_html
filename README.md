# image_to_html
A powerful tool that transforms images into clean, responsive HTML/CSS code. This repository provides an automated solution to convert visual designs, mockups, or UI screenshots into production-ready HTML code.
Image-to-HTML Generator
A deep learning model that automatically converts images into corresponding HTML code using state-of-the-art vision-language models. Built using the WebSight dataset from Hugging Face.

Objective
Develop an advanced deep learning solution that:
Takes any UI/webpage image as input
Generates semantic and functional HTML code
Maintains visual fidelity and structure
Produces clean, maintainable code
